    <h2>Staying fit: a question of attitude</h2>

    <div>In a performance-driven society that is in constant search of eternal youth, some people may find it difficult to note the effects that time has on their body. A changing figure, the appearance of wrinkles, fading hair colour, etc. Beyond these physical signs indicating that you are getting older and wiser, you may notice other changes as well: decreased energy or endurance, altered sleep, onset of health problems, etc.</div>

    <div>Health is an asset, a precious gift that is often taken for granted when we are young. As we age, we become more and more aware of its value, and sometimes, of its fragility. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to double our efforts to preserve it.</div>

    <h2>Choosing to age well</h2>

    <div>Aging is inevitable for everyone, but it is possible to keep on smiling through it all. Why not? Taking charge of your of your health and well-being will help you to get through the years with confidence and optimism. Some unavoidable factors are out of your control, such as the aging process and menopause or andropause, but you can adopt good habits and a healthy lifestyle that will help you live better, and perhaps, longer.</div>

    <div>Here are a few tips on how to stay fit and healthy. You might even feel younger!</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Follow the Canada Food Guide. This guide, (available, amongst other things, on Internet) offers tools for a healthy, varied and balanced diet according to your specific age group.</li>

        <li>Maintain a healthy weight. In addition to its harmful physical effects, being overweight can also affect your morale.</li>

        <li>Exercise regularly. It’s never too late to start. Practise an activity that you enjoy and that will promote your cardiovascular, bone and muscle health, such as walking, bike riding, swimming, dancing, etc.</li>

        <li>Take every opportunity to be active. Doing an exercise program is a great idea, but to reap the benefits of physical activity, it's simply a matter of being active a little every day.</li>

        <li>Quit smoking.  Smoking makes you age faster and is harmful to your health in all sorts of ways. No other action will have as positive an effect on your health as to quit smoking.</li>

        <li>Learn to relax. It’s now time to think of yourself and to reduce stress. Some activities may help you to relax such as yoga or meditation.</li>

        <li>Take the time to laugh and enjoy yourself. Your health and happiness depend in part on the time you set aside for yourself to have fun. Spend time with the people you love, go out to see a show and seize the opportunities to have a good laugh!</li>

        <li>Use your gray matter. Stay active both in body and mind. Defy the effects of aging on your intellectual abilities by doing activities that stimulate the mind.</li>

        <li>Discover new passions. Passion is a motor that allows us to move forward at all ages. Take on the challenge and explore hobbies that will nurture your inner flame.</li>

        <li>Follow your doctor’s recommendations. Seeing your health professionals regularly (doctor, dentist, specialist, etc.), following their advice and taking your medications every day as prescribed, are all effective ways to promote a longer and healthier life.</li>

    </ul>
    <div>Speak to your pharmacist for additional information or advice on the ways to stay fit and healthy at any age.</div>
